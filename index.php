<p>Hello, I'm Mitchell Paskins, I'm 24 years old and live just outside of London in the UK. I've been teaching myself about different aspects of web development over the past two and a half years and so far have a good understanding of HTML, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and PHP. I've been an IGN user for around 8 years, and there's rarely a day that goes by without me checking up on the latest news about games and films. I'm currently working part time in a large retailer as a sales assistant and am now looking for work as a junior web developer. I first read about Code Foo around two months ago and have enjoyed the challenges involved in the application process. Thanks very much, I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
