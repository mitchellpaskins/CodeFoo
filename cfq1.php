<h2>1. How many ping pong balls would it take to fill an average-sized school bus?</h2>

<p>According to online sources, an average American school bus is approximately 9.5ft tall, 8ft wide and between 12ft and 40ft long. By combining this information with an image of a school bus it was possible to approximate the dimensions of the main compartment of the bus.

<p>By these approximations, the main compartment of the bus would be 6.5ft (2m) tall, 8ft (2.45m) wide and 25ft (7.62m) long, giving the main compartment a volume of 37.338m&#179;. Online sources also state that a ping pong ball has a diameter of 4cm. By dividing each of the dimensions of the main compartment by the ping pong balls 4cm, it is possible to calculate the amount of ping pong balls that would fit in to the main compartment if they were stacked uniformly, as shown in the diagram below.
</p>

<p>Using this method, you could fit 61 rows (245cm / 4cm = 61.25) of ping pong balls, with 190 columns (762cm / 4cm = 190.5) in each row. To fill the bus you would need 50 (200cm / 4cm = 50) of these layers, which would amount to 579500 (61 * 190 * 50) ping pong balls. This is, however, the least efficient way of stacking, and would not be how the ping pong balls would naturally place themselves. By comparing the uniform method of stacking to a more efficient staggered method, it can be seen that for every seven rows of uniformly stacked ping pong balls, you would be able to fit 8 rows of staggered ping pong balls at the cost of 1 ping pong ball every other row.

<p>Using the previously calculated rows, columns and layers required with a uniform stacking, it is possible to calculate the staggered stacking total. By dividing the 61 rows required for uniform stacking by 7, you find the amount of extra rows that staggered stacking would allow (61 / 7 = 8.714 = 8 extra rows, 61 + 8 = 69 total rows). As shown in the above diagrams, the amount of columns per row remains the same, giving us 190 columns, which would total to 13110 (69 * 190 = 13110) ping pong balls per layer. However, as stated above, the staggered stacking comes at a cost of 1 ping pong ball for every other row, which amounts to 35 (69 / 2 = 34.5) ping pong balls to be removed from each layer, leaving 13075 balls per layer. The same logic shows that 57 (50 / 7 = 7.142 = 7 extra layers, 50 + 7 = 57 total layers) layers would be needed to fill the bus, giving a total of 745275 (57 * 13075 = 745275) ping pong balls to fill the bus.

<p>This total does not take space lost through seating or space gained with the bus steps. The passenger seats on a school bus are approximately 80cm wide, 40cm deep and 50cm high, using material that is approximately 3cm thick. These seats are often supported by two thin metal rods, with a diameter of approximately 3cm that run approximately 50cm high. This gives a single seat a volume of 22306.5cm&#179; (seat - 80cm * 40cm * 3cm = 9600cm&#179;, back - 80cm * 50cm * 3cm = 12000cm&#179;, frame - (3.14 * 1.5&#178;) * 50cm = 706.85cm&#179;, Total - 9600cm&#179; + 12000cm&#179; + 706.85cm&#179; = 22306.5cm&#179;). The bus used in this example should fit a total of 14 passenger seats, giving a total of 312291cm&#179; (22306.5cm&#179; * 14 = 312291). The drivers seat of a school bus is approximately 40cm wide, 40cm deep with a 45cm high back. The material used for the drivers seat is generally much thicker than that of a passengers seat and is closer to 6cm thick, while the framework is generally a single rod approximately 45cm long with a diameter of roughly 10cm. This gives the driver seat a volume of 23932.5cm&#179; (seat - 40cm * 40cm * 6cm = 9600cm&#179;, back - 40cm * 45cm * 6cm = 10800cm&#179;, frame - (3.14 * 5&#178;) * 45cm = 3532.5cm&#179;, Total - 9600 * 10800 * 3532.5 = 23932.5cm&#179;).
</p>
<p>The three steps at the door of the bus form a block approximately 60cm wide, 70cm high and 60cm deep, adding 252000cm&#179; to the volume. Roughly half of this added volume is filled by the stairs themselves, meaning that the actual added volume produced by the stairs is 126000cm&#179;. When the stairs and seating are taken in to consideration, the actual volume of the main compartment of the bus is 37127776.5cm&#179; (37338000 - 312291 - 23932.5 + 126000 = 37127776.5). 
</p>
<p>If a ping pong ball has a diameter of 4cm, it has a volume of 33.493cm&#179; ((4/3) * (3.14 * 2&#179;) = 33.493cm&#179;). This allows us to determine that if no space was lost between ping pong balls, the shell of the main compartment would hold 1114800 (37338000 / 33.493 = 1114800.10748) ping pong balls. Using the staggered method of stacking, it was determined that the same volume would actually hold 745275 ping pong balls. This many ping pong balls would have a combined volume of 24961495.575cm&#179; (745275 * 33.493 = 24961495.575), which means that 33.147% (3733800 / 100 = 373380, 24961495.575 / 373380 = 66.8527%, 100 - 66.8527 = 33.1473%) of the total volume was lost in the space between balls. Using this figure, it can be estimated that the actual volume of 37127776.5cm&#179; will hold 24821032.4236cm&#179; (37127776.5 / 100 = 371277.765, 371277.765 * 33.147 = 12306744.0764, 37127776.5 - 12306744.0764 = 24821032.4236), which can be converted in to 741081 balls (24821032.4236 / 33.493 = 741081.193789).
